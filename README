# Fractal-shades

The aim of this program is to provide a tool to generate a few aesthetically pleasing fractal images.

## Prerequisites

This program is written in python (python 2.7, I should have switched to python3 some time ago...) and relies on the following dependencies: numpy, matplotlib, Pillow.
(matplotlib is used for convenience for some extra outputs but is not a core dependency.)

## Getting started

Have a look first at the small gallery included (see the directory *Gallery*) ; the code  used to these images is provided.
To generate one of these example simply launch one of :
   - run_mandelbrot.py
   - run_power_tower.py
   - run_nova.py

## Program architecture

fractal.py  is the main low-level part, defining 4 classes
  - Color_tools for color operation in CIE color space (shading, color gradient, ...)
  - Fractal_colormap maps floats to colors
  - Fractal_plotter plots a fractal object
  - Fractal abstract base class encapsulating a fractal object, to be subclassed

The base class Fractal is subclassed in the following 3 files : 
    -  Classical_mandelbrot for the famous iteration z(n+1) <- zn**2 +c  (classical_mandelbrot.py)
    -  Power_tower for z(n+1) <- c**zn (Power_tower.py)
    -  Nova.py for f(z) = z**p - 1 and z(n+1) <- zn - R * f / dfdz + c (Nova.py), a fractal  familly derived from Newton fractals.

The 3 example scripts already discussed rely on those 3 classes.
