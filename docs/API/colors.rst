Color mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: fractalshades.colors

This section describe the objects provided to map reals to colors.

`Fractal_colormap` objects are usually defined through the GUI interface
(which can export them to python human-readable input format).

For convenience, a `classic_colormap` is provided (blue and orange-brown
tones), a few examples of the :doc:`../examples/index` use it.
