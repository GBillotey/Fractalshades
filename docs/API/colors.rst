Color mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: fractalshades.colors

This section describe the objects provided to map real areas to colors.

`Fractal_colormap`/s are usually defined through the GUI interface (which
can export them to python readable format).

For convenience, a `classic_colormap` is provided (blue and orange-brown
tones), a few examples of the :doc:`../examples/index` use it.

.. autoclass:: Fractal_colormap
    :members: __init__

.. autodata:: classic_colormap
