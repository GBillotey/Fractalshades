Color mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: fractalshades.colors

This section describe the objects provided to map reals to colors.

`Fractal_colormap` objects are usually defined through the GUI interface
(which import them from a picture, and also  export them to a python
human-readable input source code).

For convenience, a few template colomaps are provided (blue and orange-brown
tones), see the full list under :doc:`../examples/colormaps/plot_cmaps`.
