This project would not have been possible without the following online
resources :

 - https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~cheritat/wiki-draw/index.php/Mandelbrot_set :
   this introduction to the Mandelbrot set will pique your interest

 - https://mrob.com/pub/muency.html the *Mandelbrot Encyclopedy*, very valuable
   resource, a bit old-school look with hidden treasures.

 - https://mathr.co.uk/blog/ : a great blog, both mathematics and programming
   oriented, which covers a large set of topics in a highly instructive manner.

 - https://fractalforums.org/ : there, you will find both artistic creations
   and lively discussions on maths & computer science.
